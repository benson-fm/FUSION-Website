          In 2001, a Filipina engineer at the University of California, Irvine
          recognized the need for a dedicated space for the Filipinx community
          in STEM, specifically for engineers and scientists. This led to the
          establishment of the Filipinx Undergraduate Scientists-Engineers In an
          Organized Network, or FUSION.

          Since then, FUSION has experienced tremendous growth, now boasting
          over 300 members from diverse backgrounds, including not only
          engineers and scientists but students from various fields. FUSION at
          UC Irvine stands as a welcoming, Filipino-led student organization
          that embraces all academic pursuits and walks of life.
